Nowadays, people living in hustling cities usually have a busy life with little time for consumption records and property settlement. Meanwhile, the development of online shopping makes it easier to consume some useless goods impulsively. Therefore, many people may lack a correct understanding of their shopping habits and financial situation.
In this project, we would like to design an accounting system to help people manage their wealth smartly. The system will contain following functions:
1. Add records of income and expenses.;

2. The records would contain some basic information, like amount, date, types of income or expense (e.g. food, game, salary, etc. The maximum number of types that can be created is 50), account (e.g. cash, bank card, credit card, etc. The maximum number of accounts that can be created is 20);

3. The records could be deleted or edited at any time;

4. Users could view their records by date, type, and account;

5. The system provides a statistical report of usersâ€™ financial state (e.g. monthly income and expenses, percentage of food expenses, etc.);

6. The accounting system allows budget setting. When expenses reach the budget, there should be an alert.

7. "Wonderlist" function: users could set a target amount of deposit and clarify the aim of it (e.g. $10000 for an overseas trip), when the deposit reaches the target number, there would be a notice.
