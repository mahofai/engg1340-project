Nowadays,people who living in hustling cities usually live a busy and stressful life with little spare time, meanwhile , the advance smartphones and online shopping make shopping much more convenient than before. Therefore, many people may regard shopping as a kind of entertainment. lacking a correct understanding of their financial situation, many young people overdraft their credit card to buy unecessary things and have allmost no deposite. 
  In this project,We would like to design an accounting system to help people manage their wealth smartly.The system will contain following functions:
1. Add records of income and expenses;

2. The records would contain some basic information, like amount, date, types of income or expense (e.g. food, game,salary, etc.), account (e.g cash, bank card, credit card, etc.); 

3. The records could be deleted and edited at any time;

4. Users could view their records by date, type, and account;

5. The system provide statistical report of usersâ€™ financial state (e.g. monthly income and expenses, percentage of food expenses, etc.); 

6. The accounting system allows budget setting. When expenses reach the budget, there should be an alert from the system.

7. "Wonderlist" function: user could set a target number of deposit and the aim of it(e.g $10000 for an oversea trip), when the deposit reach the target number, there would be a notice.
